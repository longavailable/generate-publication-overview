| Abstract       | Preserving lacustrine ecosystems is vital for sustainable watershed development, and forecasting the environmental water availability of lakes would support policymakers in developing sound management strategies. This study proposed a methodology that merges the lake water level prediction and environmental water availability evaluation. The temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model forecasted the lake water levels for the next 7 days by inputting the streamflow and lake water level data for the past 30 days. The environmental water availability was assessed by comparing the forecasted lake water levels with the environmental water requirements, resulting in adequate, regular, scarce, and severely scarce environmental water availability. The methodology was tested in two case studies: Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, the two largest freshwater lakes in the Yangtze River Basin, China. The TFT model â€¦	|
