Urban stormwater management measures, such as permeable pavement systems (PPSs), have been widely implemented to alleviate increasingly severe urban water-related problems. However, the effectiveness of PPSs in runoff control under different rainfall conditions has not been fully investigated, particularly in China. Therefore, there is an urgent need to study the...

| Abstract       | Urban stormwater management measures, such as permeable pavement systems (PPSs), have been widely implemented to alleviate increasingly severe urban water-related problems. However, the effectiveness of PPSs in runoff control under different rainfall conditions has not been fully investigated, particularly in China. Therefore, there is an urgent need to study the hydrological benefits of different PPSs in China. In this paper, five PPSs at the Zhenjiang sponge base, including one pervious concrete (PC), two permeable interlocking concrete pavements (PICP1 and PICP2), and two permeable bricks (PB1 and PB2), were selected as study cases. Surface runoff coefficients, underdrain runoff coefficients, total runoff volume reductions, and peak flow reductions during rainfall events throughout the flood seasons of 2019 and 2020 were calculated. The influence of rainfall characteristics, pavement type, and pavement â€¦	|
