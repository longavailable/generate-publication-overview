| Abstract       | Recently, the Poyang Lake basin, one of the important commodity grain bases in China, is experiencing severe low-water conditions, frequent droughts, which reduced grain production and caused serious agricultural losses. Since the Poyang Lake basin is, decreasing the grain loss caused by drought in the region Research on the systematic agricultural drought to reduce the food loss in the Poyang Lake basin plays a critical role in guaranteeing the food security of China. Based on the daily ground soil moisture monitoring data of 22 moisture stations from 2011 to 2020, the daily rainfall data of 49 rainfall gauge stations from 1956 to 2020, and the meteorological data from 2016 to 2019 in the irrigation area where the moisture station located, we used the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI), which considers the physiological state of vegetation, to characterize agricultural drought. The temporal and spatial distribution of â€¦	|
