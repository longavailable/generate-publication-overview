| Abstract       | In order to enhance the ability of urban waterlogging prevention and improve urban adaptability of urban areas to changing environments, it is significantly important to investigate the hydrological benefits of different sponge facilities under the climate pattern of the Yangtze Delta region. Four typical sponge facilities in the Zhenjiang Sponge Base, the first national sponge pilot city, were selected as the study cases. Several indicators, such as runoff coefficient, runoff reduction rate, peak-cutting rate, and flood peak, were selected to evaluate the rainfall-runoff relationship, analyze the hydrological performance under different rainfall intensities and patterns, and explore the impact of operation time on the hydrological benefits of the sponge facilities. The results showed that the permeable pavement sponge facilities demonstrated a single rainfall-runoff relationship, and in contrast the green plant facilities showed a â€¦	|
