| Abstract       | Estimating ecological environmental flow in tidal rivers is one of the major challenges for sustainable water resource management in estuaries and river basins. This paper presents an ecological environmental flow framework that was developed to accommodate highly dynamic medium tidal estuaries found along the Yellow Sea coast of China. The framework not only proposes a method of water quality-based ecological flow for tidal gate-controlled rivers but also proposes a method of water demand for scouring and silting to protect ports in coastal viscous sediment environments. The framework integrates the instream water requirements of water quality, sediment and basic ecological flow, and considers the temporal and spatial variation differences for the environmental flow requirements of tidal rivers. This study emphasizes the significance and necessity of continuous monitoring of ecological data in â€¦	|
